- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing specific other than Minecraft clients
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with event systems, priority, and bypasses.
- 💬 Ask me about something and I will curse your pillow to be warm forever.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I cube, read, code, sleep, eat, breathe, and other unusual things.

You can tell, that I have very little experience with markdown, and can't be bothered to research.  
You can also tell there is nothing on there, so go away please, and thank you.
